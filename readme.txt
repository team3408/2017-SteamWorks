This is our code for the 2017 SteamWorks season

this is our coding schedule for the season:
1. Write tank drive
    This should already be written but we have not tested it yet
2. Gear loader code
    This is the code for the toaster.
    This is going to probably be powered by 2 worm gears
    We will need to power probably 2 gear boxes

- END OF WEEK TWO. WE PLAN TO HAVE 1 AND 2 DONE BY THIS TIME

3. Shooter code
    Code for the conveyer belt and needs to go forward and backwards.
    This will probably include 2 motors
    Code for the fly wheel.
    We do not know if it is two wheels or one yet
4. Auto Code
5. Climber code
    Only if everything else is done and if we have time.
    Only if David can research it.
